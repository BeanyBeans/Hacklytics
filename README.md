#**BingeNite**

## **What it does: Mood-based Movie and Song Recommender**

The main purpose of BingeNite is to generate customized lists of entertainment media based on the user's mood and desired genre. Our website implements multiple datasets obtained from the Kaggle database website. To parse data from datasets, we used optimized Javascript algorithms and filtered the dataset based on user preferences. After obtaining a customized list of media for the user, weâ€™ll be displaying contents using React.js and CSS styling.

## **Inspiration:**
Our inspiration for this project stemmed from the desire to create a personalized experience for users seeking entertainment recommendations. We recognized the abundance of movie and song datasets available on platforms like Kaggle and saw an opportunity to implement machine learning algorithms to customize suggestions based on user mood and preferred genres. Our website provides relevant recommendations, enhancing user engagement and satisfaction.

## **What we Learned:**
Throughout the project, we worked with data processing, front-end design, data extraction, machine learning, and web development, to preprocess and analyze large datasets, implement machine learning models for recommendation systems, and integrate them into a web application. 

## **How we built it:**
Our project was built using a combination of Node.js, React.js, and web development technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We started by exploring and preprocessing movie and song datasets from Kaggle, extracting relevant features, and training machine learning models to predict user preferences based on genre selections. We then developed a web application using React to serve as the interface for users to input genre preferences and receive personalized recommendations.

## **Challenges we ran into:**
One of the main challenges was handling and preprocessing large datasets, as well as fine-tuning the machine learning algorithms to accurately predict user preferences while balancing model complexity and performance. 

##**Accomplishments We're Proud Of:**
Creating a clean and intuitive web interface 
Leveraging Kaggle datasets and machine learning techniques to enhance user experience by generating tailored entertainment suggestions.

##**What's Next for Us:**
Enhancing the recommendation system by incorporating additional features such as collaborative filtering and content-based filtering to further improve recommendation accuracy.
Expanding the scope of our project to include recommendations for other forms of entertainment such as books, TV shows, and podcasts.
